# BURN THIS YEAR

### Overview

A collective internet vending post for the terrible year that was 2016. Think a cathartic reddit with 'burn' instead of upvotes.

Look out for the Easter Egg when a certain post is 'upvoted'/'burnt' 2016 times (hint: oh no! 2016 was too terrible to handle - we had to destroy the database!).
